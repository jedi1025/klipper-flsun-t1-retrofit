Welcome to the Klipper project!

The Klipper firmware controls 3d-Printers. It combines the power of a
general purpose computer with one or more micro-controllers. See the
[features document](https://www.klipper3d.org/Features.html) for more
information on why you should use the Klipper software.

Start by [installing Klipper software](https://www.klipper3d.org/Installation.html).

Klipper software is Free Software. See the [license](COPYING) or read
the [documentation](https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html). We
depend on the generous support from our
[sponsors](https://www.klipper3d.org/Sponsors.html).


all that out of the way...


DO NOT USE THIS YET.  IT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!!
...
HOWEVER...

Update 06/01/2025:
/config/flsun-retrofit/WIP-printer.cfg "SHOULD" be good enough to get started with.  

I have a new Intel SBC and BTT Kraken arriving tomorrow (hopefully...thanks Amazon) and 
will begin actual testing once all is wired up.  If you wish to test this config file on 
your own, you may freely do so, however it is YOUR responsibility to make sure all 
precautions are taken not to damage anything when those arms start swinging around.  

I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY for anybody using something i haven't personally tested yet.  

That being said, if you try it, whatever the results, please do share them.

Update 06/02/2025:
Yup, Amazon strikes again.  Kraken DOA...3 more days...

More to come...
